# Hyper Casual Three.js Game

This repository contains a very simple hyper casual game built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The player controls a cube moving left and right across three lanes to avoid incoming obstacles.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser that supports WebGL.
2. Use the **Left** and **Right** arrow keys to move the player cube.
3. Avoid the red cubes coming toward you. Colliding with an obstacle ends the game.

The game is intentionally minimal and serves as a starting point for experimenting with Three.js and basic endless runner mechanics.
