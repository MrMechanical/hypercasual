# Hyper Casual Three.js Game

This repository contains a very simple hyper casual game built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). The player controls a cube moving left and right across three lanes to avoid incoming obstacles. The game now includes basic textures and touch controls so it plays nicely on mobile devices.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in a web or mobile browser that supports WebGL.
2. Use the **Left** and **Right** arrow keys or the on-screen buttons on mobile to move the player cube.
3. Avoid the red cubes coming toward you. Colliding with an obstacle ends the game.

The game is intentionally minimal and serves as a starting point for experimenting with Three.js and basic endless runner mechanics.
